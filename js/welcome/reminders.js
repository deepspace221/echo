You're doing a great job, {user}! **Almost done**. 
But what about your native language? You **MUST** tell us!! :laughing: 

Please note that with a **native language role** you will be removed from the **unassigned role**, and be granted access to additional rooms, such as the <#349824543424118784> and <#349824543424118784> among other benefits.

Command example:
```css
.iam n. German
```
Please also note that members without roles will eventually be **prune** from the server.
